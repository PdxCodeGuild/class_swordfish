# Name: Quiz Me!

## Project Overview:
I'll be creating a website where users can register and once they are registered they will be able to sign in with their name and pin number that they registered with. Once logged in, the user will have the ability to create a customized quiz or answer quizes created by other users. To achieve this, I'll be using HTML and CSS for designing the website as well as Django.

## Features:
As a user, I want to be able to create my own account so that I am able to save the quizes that I create as well as the quizes i take that other users created.
