        <p class="cool-paragraph">The green tree python (Morelia viridis) is a species of snake in the family Pythonidae. 
            The species is native to New Guinea, some islands in Indonesia, and the Cape York Peninsula in Australia. 
            First described by Hermann Schlegel in 1872, it was known for many years as Chondropython viridis. As its common name suggests, 
            it is a bright green snake that can reach a total length (including tail) of 2 m (6.6 ft) and 
            a weight of 1.6 kg (3.5 lb), with females slightly larger and heavier than males. Living generally 
            in trees, the green tree python mainly hunts and eats small reptiles and mammals. It is a popular pet, 
            and numbers in the wild have suffered with large-scale smuggling of wild-caught green tree pythons in Indonesia. 
            Despite this, the green tree python is rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of endangered species.</p>
