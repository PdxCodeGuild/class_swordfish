#### The Django Project Setup STATICFILES_DIRS ERROR has been causing issues:
1. Instead of using the `os.path.join`,  I can use `'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / 'templates']` 
2.  We also use `STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / 'static']` instead of `os.path.join` etc from the template.


#### lookup what `BASE_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent` is within the django settings

1. ACTION: Will Vincent Custom User tutorial google search for creating users in Django will help with the next section
2. ACTION: Look up django request information and background execution info

### Custom User Model Notes

#### class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=60)
    post_body = models.CharField(max_length=128)
    # auth.user links the post to the user model in the auth app
    # I need to impor thte CustomUser above from the users app, and reference the model item below
    # related_name allows u to access all of the posts by an auther by user.posts
    # the default is users.modelnam_set but we assign it a new location
    # on_delete is what happens if an author user is deleted, if an author is delete all posts are deleted
    author = models.ForeignKey(CustomUser, related_name="posts", on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    created_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    edited_date = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)

    def __str__(self):
        # look up how to refer to the post with the author also
        return self.title
