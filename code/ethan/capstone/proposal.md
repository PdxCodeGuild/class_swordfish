# List Fabricator

## Project Overview

I'd like to build a website that wargamers could use to easily create army lists.  Creating an army list is the fist step in playing a match of warhammer 40k.  Its often a very tedius process that involves math and rule checking. I will use django, pandas, and vue to make this website.

## Features

As a 40k player, i would like to a website that is easy to use where you could simply click buttons next to pictures to add units to your roster.  Id like the roster to be saved and easily printable when complete. 

## Data Model

factions
unit type
unit
wargear

## Schedule
