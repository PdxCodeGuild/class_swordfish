                <img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qi5S1kNrKew/VQCKotxDgfI/AAAAAAABAMk/XtGfRLCPzGU/s1600/mr-kruger.jpg">
                <p>He is the president of Kruger Industrial Smoothing which is best known for a job they did for the Statue of Liberty in which "they failed to get the green stuff off". Kruger is somewhat known for not caring about his job, instead focusing on trivial matters like who tells the best jokes or what everyone's nicknames should be at meetings. This often leaves the office in total chaos. Kruger also has a wife and two kids and it is revealed that one time, when his family was at the beach, they threw George's stuff into the water and blamed it on the tide. Mr. Kruger also made a very generous donation of 20,000 to the human fund.</p>

                <h4>Jackie Chiles</h3>
                <img src="https://tv-fanatic-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--gVLQlJQV--/t_slideshow/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1485241907/slides/2226/jackie-chiles.jpg">
                <p>Jackie Chiles represents Kramer in three different cases. In the first case, Kramer sneaks a cafe latte into a movie theatre. As he climbs over another person to get to his seat, Kramer spills the latte and burns himself. "The Maestro" gives Kramer a balm, which cures the burn. The coffee company offers a settlement: a tiny amount of money and a lifetime of free lattes; Kramer takes the offer before the executive finishes speaking, much to Jackie's chagrin. In the second case, Kramer's face ages prematurely when he turns his apartment into a smoking lounge. Jackie promises to get rich off Kramer's gross disfigurement, but Kramer settles the case for a Marlboro-man style billboard featuring his own face. On case number three, Jackie sues Oh Henry! candy bar heiress Sue Ellen Mishky for walking the streets of New York wearing only a bra (given to her by Elaine) and causing Kramer to wreck George Costanza's car. He describes her actions as "lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!" The lawsuit fails however, when Kramer (inspired by Stan the Caddy, inspired by O.J. Simpson trying on the glove at his trial) demands she tries on the bra to prove her ownership of it. She fails to snap it because she has to try wearing it on top of her clothes. Her own lawyer argues "If the bra doesn't fit, you must acquit!" Jackie represents George, Elaine, Jerry and Kramer, when they violate the Good Samaritan Law. Jackie never looses a case, however, he never won one while Kramer was involved.</p>

                <h4>Frank Costanza</h3>
                <img src="https://i0.wp.com/newportbuzz.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/05/seinfeld-frank-costanza.jpg?ssl=1">
                <p>Though currently retired, we learn in "The Understudy" that Frank once worked as a salesman selling Christian artifacts and that he is fluent in Korean. He also claims to have spoken to Unification Church leader Sun Myung Moon. Frank is an exceptionally good chef (he spent time as an Army cook with the "Fighting 103rd" during the Korean War), as long as he can overcome his fears of accidentally poisoning people with his cooking (which showed the rebuttal in "The Fatigues", in which he destroyed his food after seeing Elaine Benes' co-worker at the J. Peterman Catalog, Eddie Sherman, choking).</p>

        <h3>Meet the Founder</h3>
        <h4>George Costanza</h4>
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/07/c0/25/07c0258eaa1114c2fef62fdac5612377--seinfeld-meme-funny-people.jpg">
        <p>George Costanza is the generous founder of the Human Fund. George has numerous psychological problems, including: sociopathy (officially referred to as Antisocial Personality Disorder), narcissism, habitual lying, low self-esteem, sudden fits of anger, hypochondriasis, impulsive acts of ill-considered cheapness, selfishness, obsessiveness, living in fantasy. Like Kramer, he would often concoct elaborate plots to weasel out of relational, financial, or legal obligations, always with unexpected and negative consequences. George's lying, however, is often seen as a gift in the eyes of himself and his friends. It is noted in some episodes that he can even beat a lie-detector test. When Jerry tells Elaine about his plan of beating a lie detector instead of somehow avoiding it, she replies, "Who do you think you are, Costanza?"</p>
