    <p>Doomguy, referred to as Doom Slayer since the 2016 reboot and simply Doom in Quake III, 
        is the titular main protagonist of the Doom video game franchise. He is a mysterious and
         somewhat ambiguous character that not much is known about. He is a space marine that has
          a sworn hatred of demons. He is hailed as the savior of the human race and sworn as the
           bane of hell itself. He is the main character in most of the game series, however, in 
           Doom 3, he is seemingly replaced by a different character. He is also in some way the 
           descendant of B.J. Blazkowicz, the hero of WWII. Despite this, in Doom Eternal: The 
           Ancient Gods, it's mentioned that Doomguy was possibly conceived by Davoth, 
           better known as the Dark Lord.</p>
