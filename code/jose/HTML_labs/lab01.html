        <h1 class = 'title'>Geralt of Rivia, The White Wolf's early life.</h1>

        <p class="paragraphs">Geralt was born as the son of the sorceress Visenna and presumably, the warrior Korin. Shortly after his birth,
            his mother left him with the School of the Wolf at the stronghold of Kaer Morhen. There,
            Geralt was made and trained to become a Witcher. As a child, he was subjected to the Trial of The Grasses,
            he managed to survive the many blistering mutations required to grant Witcher's their abilities.
            After displaying unusual tolerance, Geralt was selected to further experimental mutations which granted him considerably
            greater strength, speed, endurance, resilience, healing, senses, complete immunity to diseases and conventional poisons, and
            extreme resistance to pain. This resulted in his hair turning white and received the nickname 'White Wolf'.<p>

            <div class = 'geralt-quote'>"You don't need mutations to strip men of their humanity. I've seen plenty of examples." - Geralt of Rivia, also known as the Butcher of Blaviken</div>
            <hr>
            <p class="paragraphs">Geralt was trained by his mentor Vesemir whom he came to regard as a father-figure. He soon met his fellow classmate
            Eskel and the two became good friends and as close as brothers. One time, they captured a large forest bumblebee and tied it to a
            jug. The pair laughed at its antics until they were discovered by Vesemir who punished them with a leather strap.
            During his training at the witcher school, he made friends with several students, such as Gweld and Eskel, and was trained by Vesemir in harsh conditions,
            one in which resulted in a student dying. Geralt was eventually put through the Trial of Forest Eyes, where he was left tied up in the woods
            and blindfolded and needed to return to the keep by the morning or he would fail. He was helped out of his binds by the elf Aideen, where
            they went to look at the non-human reservation to find the camp had been attacked by vrans. They then left and came across some Cat School
            witchers training and wrestling. Aideen then unbound Geralt and left him to return to his master. Later on, the Wolf School and the Cat School
            had a tournament between them, organized by King Radowit II who secretly plotted with the Cat School to kill the witchers from the Wolf School.
            In the first round, Geralt and Gweld faced off, slowly realizing while they were fighting that the whole tournament was a ruse. As they came to
            that realization however, a druid put a mind control spell upon Gweld which made him violently attack Geralt, forcing Geralt to kill his friend
            with a sword through the chest. Right after this, soldiers under Radowit's command surrounded the witchers and started to kill them all, but
            Geralt was able to escape on horseback, causing Radowit to put a bounty on his head. Geralt hen came across Aideen again in the woods,
            who persuaded him not to kill the soldiers who slaughtered his fellow witchers, though he did kill one of Radowit's men that he saw along
            his trip back to Hertch, where he warned the elders about Radowit and the Cat School's betrayal.</p>
            <p class = 'places-paragraph'>Due to the nature of his work as a witcher, a monster slayer, Geralt of Rivia only truly called one place home: Kaer Morhen. Kaer Morhen was a 
                witcher fortress where young boys would be taken to and there lived and trained to become witchers. The fortress itself fell into dissaray after
                an attack on it from outside forces. 
                Some places that are of note during his travels on The Path:
