#Lab 1: Unit Converter(redo)
'''
'''
This lab will involve writing a program, that allows the user to convert a number between units
'''
'''
Version 1
'''
'''
Ask the user for the number of feet, and print out the equivalent distance in meters. 
Hint: 1 ft is 0.3048 m. 
So we can get the output in meters by multiplying the input distance by 0.3048.
'''
units = {
    'feet': 0.3048,
}
