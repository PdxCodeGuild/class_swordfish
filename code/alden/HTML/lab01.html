        <p><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_CurieMadam">Madam Curie</a> was a woman of firsts.  Not only was she the first women to be awarded a Nobel Prize, she was the first to win twice and to date is still the only women to win 2.
        Without her, we would not have things like x-rays and medications that rely on radiation.  She is credited with the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium.
        Her studies on isotopes help lead to the discovery of nuclear fission.
