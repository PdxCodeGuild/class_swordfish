                <h3>Defensive Missile</h3>
                <p>Dr. No: I’m a member of SPECTRE James Bond: SPECTRE? Dr. No: SPECTRE. Special Executive for Counter Intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, Extortion. The four great cornerstones of power headed by the greatest brains in the world. James Bond: Correction. Criminal brains! Dr. No: The successful criminal brain is always superior. It has to be! [Bond is suited up and pacing as he waits in a room when Eve enters] Eve: She’s ready for you. James Bond: I’m sorry, have we met before? Eve: I’m the one who should say sorry. James Bond: Well, it’s only four ribs, and some of the less vital organs. [Bond walks towards her, he leans closer to her as he passes her by] James Bond: Nothing major. [Eve smiles as she follows him]</p>

                <h3>Machine Gun Ammo</h3>
                <p>[Bond is sitting down in a museum, looking at a painting, when Q arrives and sits next to him] Q: Always makes me feel a bit melancholy. A grand old war ship, being ignominiously hauled away for scrap. The inevitability of time, don’t you think? What do you see? James Bond: A bloody big ship. Excuse me. [Bond starts to get up] Q: 007. I’m your new Quartermaster. James Bond: You must be joking. Q: Why, because I’m not wearing a lab coat? James Bond: Because you still have spots. Q: My complexion is hardly relevant. James Bond: Your competence is. Q: Age is no guarantee of efficiency. James Bond: And youth is no guarantee of innovation.</p>

                <h3>Fire Starter</h3>
                <p>Pussy Galore: What happened? Where’s Goldfinger? James Bond: Playing his golden harp. Fiona: Some men just don’t like to be driven. James Bond: No, some men don’t like to be taken for a ride.  Draco: My apologies for the way you were brought here. I wasn’t sure you’d accept a formal invitation. James Bond: There’s always something formal about the point of a pistol.</p>

The four great cornerstones of power headed by the greatest brains in the world. James Bond: Correction. Criminal brains! Dr. No: The successful criminal brain is always superior. It has to be! [as Bond follows behind Severine towards the bar, Bond hears Eve through his earpiece] Eve: She’s pretty. James Bond: I know. Eve: If you like that sort of thing. [Bond takes his earpiece off and whispers into it] James Bond: I’ll keep you posted. [as he walks past Eve, who’s sitting a table drinking, he drops his earpiece into her drink] [Bond is suited up and pacing as he waits in a room when Eve enters] Eve: She’s ready for you. James Bond: I’m sorry, have we met before? Eve: I’m the one who should say sorry. James Bond: Well, it’s only four ribs, and some of the less vital organs. [Bond walks towards her, he leans closer to her as he passes her by] James Bond: Nothing major. [Eve smiles as she follows him]</p>
