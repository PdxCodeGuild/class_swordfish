        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Dwyane Tyrone Wade Jr. is an American former professional basketball player.
            Wade spent the majority of his 16-year career playing for the Miami Heat of
            the National Basketball Association (NBA) and won three NBA championships,
            was a 13-time NBA All-Star, an 8-time member of the All-NBA Team, and a 3-time
            member of the All-Defensive Team. Wade is also Miami's all-time leader in points,
            games, assists, steals, shots made, and shots taken. Wade is currently the
            host of the American adaptation of The Cube.</p>
        <p>After a successful college basketball career with the Marquette Golden Eagles,
            including leading the team to the Final Four in 2003, Wade was drafted fifth
            overall in the 2003 NBA draft by the Heat. In his third season, Wade led the Heat
            to their first NBA Championship and was named the 2006 NBA Finals MVP. At the 2008
            Summer Olympics, Wade led the United States men's basketball team, commonly known
            as the "Redeem Team", in scoring and helped them capture the gold medal. In the
            2008-09 season, Wade led the league in both total points (2,386) and points per
            game (30.2), the latter stat earning him his sole NBA scoring title. Wade was selected
            as the NBA All-Star Game MVP in 2010. With LeBron James and Chris Bosh, Wade helped
            guide Miami to four consecutive NBA Finals from 2011 to 2014, and won back-to-back
            championships in 2012 and 2013. Wade briefly left Miami to play for the Chicago Bulls
            and the Cleveland Cavaliers throughout 2016-2018 before returning to Miami to finish
            his playing career and retire with the Heat in 2019. The Heat retired his #3 jersey
            in 2020. He purchased a minority ownership stake in the Utah Jazz in 2021. In October
            2021, Wade was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all-time by being
            named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.</p>

        <h2>Quote</h2>
        <q>Yes, it's true. I love the roar of the crowd. When the fans are with you, their voices
            come together in a big booming rush of sound that you can actually feel in your body - 
            almost like a wave that lifts you and carries you past your own limits.</q>
