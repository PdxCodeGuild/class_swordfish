to do:

preserve html layout? or adjust text to standard layout
save and retrieve to file functionality
improve keywords - learn from recipes? save all ingredient lists to file and loop back for most common
test short recipes
make pdf?
remove 'recipe' from titles
if no keywords found?  

----

Problems with V1:
recipe text pulled from all_text is not very clean.
sometimes it pulls too much at the beginning, and it always chops the last bit off.
recipe text is in whatever format all_text is; sometimes all on one
line, sometimes each ingredient has its own line, sometimes there are multiple
new lines between each ingredient.
sometimes there are non-ascii letter characters such as checkboxes

potential iterations:
save as pdf, visually analyze layout/text

possible solution:
case 1: program check to see if recipe is on one or two line
    if so, break up each ingredient with a new line. no idea how to accomplish this
case 2: program check to see if recipe is broken up in multiple lines
    clear all new lines and delineate ingredient and instructions
once the pattern is determined, collect the rest of text immediately following the
    pattern in order to capture the rest of the ingredients/instructions
refine the ingredient keyword list to contain only measurement nouns. this would
    make ingredient delineation more clear



V2 thoughts:
should check for all bold tags, aka headers - list headers, then pull sections with keyword hits
header tag?
soup.find_all(re.compile('^h[1-6]$'))
