Geological info via USGS (https://www.usgs.gov/volcanoes/three-sisters/eruption-history-broken-top):
Eruptive products from Broken Top range from basalt to rhyodacite. Its ancient cone has been
deeply eroded leaving isolated peaks with little of its original surface intact. There are deep
erosional embayments in addition to the south cirque, an amphitheater-like opening with steep
ridges at the summit. The basalt of Cayuse Crater forms an unrelated area of lava flows and scoria
cones that erupted about 11 ka on the southwest apron of the long-inactive Broken Top edifice.

            Broken Top is a dormant volcano named for its appearance- the top of the mountain was ground
            away by glaciers. The mountain lies in the cascades mountain range in Oregon, close to the city
            of Bend, OR. The mountain is a popular climbing destination with a summit of 9,177
            ft. There are also beautiful trails surrounding the mountain, making it a popular hiking
            destination as well. The mountain is very close to the three sisters, which are also great places
            to hike and climb.
